# AniTUI

While `ani-cli` is pretty good, it aims to be minimalistic. This has compromized some functionality.

AniTUI attemts to have all the features of `ani-cli` while adding some more interactivity.

# Features

## CLI

- Searching on <https://goload.pro>
- Getting information about an anime such as its description and episode list

# Documentation

- Command line options are automatically documented via `clap`. Do `--help` or `-h` to read a short manual.

- Code documentation is avaliable via `cargo doc`

# When is this going to crates.io?

Not yet. For a `0.1.0` I would like to have most `ani-cli` features complete, such as:

- [x] Searching by title
- [x] Episode list
- [x] Description
- [ ] Watching anime in mpv
